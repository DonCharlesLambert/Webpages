                The 2016 United States presidential election was the 58th
                quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8,
                2016. The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and
                Indiana governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of
                former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and U.S. senator from
                Virginia Tim Kaine, despite losing the popular vote. Trump
                took office as the 45th president, and Pence as the 48th vice
                president, on January 20, 2017.

                The dynamic between Bush and opponent Donald Trump was one of
                the more contentious relationships among the Republican
                contenders. Bush's campaign spent millions of dollars on
                anti-Trump ads, while in response Trump mocked Jeb Bush with the
                epithet that he was "low energy". Trump told CNN "the last thing
                we need is another Bush" in the White House after the
                much-criticized presidencies of his father and brother.
                Trump criticized Bush's elder brother and his role in the Iraq
                War throughout the Republican debates, leading Bush to defend
                his brother. During an exchange between Bush and Trump in the
                ninth Republican primary debate, the audience repeatedly booed
                Trump. Trump scoffed that the audience was made up of "Jeb's
                special interests and lobbyists".

                On March 22, during a live debate, Biden stated that he never
                called for social security cuts, a statement
                that his critics assert is false.

                In a virtual town hall with CNN on March 27, Biden said that the
                Trump administration had not made an effort to send U.S. medical
                experts to China to investigate the outbreak of coronavirus
                disease 2019, a claim FactCheck.org characterized as false.
                Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar had said at a
                January 28 press conference, "On January 6, we offered to send a
                CDC team to China that could assist with these public health
                efforts."

                In May 2020, Biden stated he has been endorsed by NAACP, a claim
                the organization denied
